# cardano-tx-tools

Tooling for Conway-era Cardano transactions. Seven command-line
executables plus the Haskell library that backs them.

## Executables

- [**tx-diff**](tx-diff.md) — structural diff between two Conway
  transactions, with Plutus blueprint-aware decoding and opt-in
  input resolution via N2C or Blockfrost-style HTTP.
- [**tx-inspect**](tx-inspect.md) — render one Conway transaction
  as a structured, human-readable report. Optional
  [rewriting-rules YAML](rewriting-rules.md) drives two stages
  (collapse + rename) on top of the verbatim render; same loader
  and per-leaf renderer `tx-diff` uses.
- [**tx-sign**](tx-sign.md) — age-encrypted signing-key vault and
  detached vkey witness creation. The cleartext signing key never
  touches disk and the passphrase is never read from `argv`.
- [**tx-validate**](tx-validate.md) — Conway Phase-1 pre-flight for
  unsigned transactions, driven via Node-to-Client against a local
  `cardano-node`. Returns the ledger's verdict as a human or JSON
  envelope; exit code is the contract (0 clean, 1 structural, ≥2
  config/resolver error).
- [**tx-graph**](tx-graph.md) — emit one Conway transaction as a
  canonical Turtle (or JSON-LD) graph: operator-entity overlay
  (from a rules file), body decomposition (inputs / outputs /
  certificates / mints / withdrawals / proposals / fees), Plutus
  blueprint-decoded datums and redeemers (including CIP-57
  `SchemaMap` per-entry triples), and address decompositions.
  Same loader as `tx-inspect --rules`.
- [**tx-view**](tx-view.md) — project a `tx-graph`-emitted
  canonical graph through one of four packaged views:
  `cli-tree` (text tree of the body), `asset-flow` (TSV of value
  movements), `entity-occurrences` (TSV of entity touch counts),
  or `json-ld` (full graph as JSON-LD). The four views ship as
  paired contracts: vendor-neutral `.rq` SPARQL files for any
  standards-compliant runtime, plus in-process Haskell projections
  that produce the same byte stream without a SPARQL engine.
- [**cardano-tx-generator**](cardano-tx-generator.md) — long-running
  daemon that drives a configurable mix of Conway transactions
  against a node for soak / fuzz testing.

Plus one shell-script tool, shipped under `scripts/`:

- [**tx-lattice**](tx-lattice.md) — thin Bash wrapper around
  `tx-graph` that resolves a batch of mainnet / testnet transactions
  (plus their direct inputs) via Blockfrost into one canonical
  Turtle file per tx, ready for cross-tx SPARQL queries. Stop-gap
  prototype for a future Haskell executable.

The [rewriting-rules grammar](rewriting-rules.md) document pins
the shared YAML language consumed by both `tx-inspect --rules`
and `tx-diff --collapse-rules`, and is the same rules format
`tx-graph --rules` reads to drive its entity overlay.

For context on how this stack relates to existing
blockchain-RDF / linked-data work (EthOn, BLONDiE, AllegroGraph's
Bitcoin demo, CIP-57, Reutter–Soto–Vrgoč on SPARQL recursion),
