Description : Source-UTxO picking from the population
License     : Apache-2.0

Pure logic for the @transact@ arm's source selection
(per @specs/034-cardano-tx-generator/data-model.md§Source UTxO@):
sample an HD index uniformly from @[0, nextHDIndex)@ using
the request seed's 'StdGen'; ask whether that index has a
viable UTxO; on a "no", advance the same RNG stream and
retry up to @maxRetries@ times; on cap-hit, return
'Nothing' so the daemon can map it to
@no-pickable-source@ (FR-006).

The viability predicate is supplied by the caller. The
daemon's wiring closes over @snapshotAt@ + the K-output
floor; tests close over an in-memory @Map Word64 Bool@.
The function is otherwise oblivious to ledger types — the
'IO' is only there because the predicate may need it.

{- | Repeatedly draw an index from the request's RNG
stream and call the viability predicate. Returns the
first viable index (and the RNG state at that point so
the caller can keep using the same deterministic stream
for downstream sampling), or 'Nothing' after
@maxRetries@ unsuccessful draws.

Total RNG draws on a successful pick is between 1 and
@maxRetries + 1@ — every call site reads the same number
of words for the same seed/state pair, so determinism
(FR-002 / SC-002) is preserved.

If @nextHDIndex@ is zero (cold-start population) the
predicate is never called and 'Nothing' is returned
immediately.

{- | Pre-submit chain-tip probe. Returns 'True' when every
input in the supplied set is still unspent at the relay's
current chain tip, 'False' when at least one input is missing.

One LSQ round-trip via 'queryUTxOByTxIn'. Raises
'Cardano.Node.Client.N2C.Types.ConnectionLost' on bearer
failure (propagated from the underlying query); callers
catch this exception at the arm level and map it to
@IndexNotReady@.

Empty input set is vacuously 'True' — there is nothing to
verify.
