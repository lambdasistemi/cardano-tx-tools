Module      : Cardano.Tx.Generator.Persist
Description : On-disk persistence for the cardano-tx-generator daemon
License     : Apache-2.0

Two files inside the daemon's @--state-dir@:

* @master.seed@ — 32 raw bytes, written once at bootstrap,
  read-only thereafter. Sources the deterministic
  derivation in
  'Cardano.Tx.Generator.Population'.

* @next-hd-index@ — UTF-8 decimal 'Word64' followed by a
  single newline. Atomically rewritten via tempfile +
  rename after every successful @transact@ or @refill@
  request. Returns 0 on cold start (file absent).

Atomic rewrite: write to @<path>.tmp@, flush, close,
@rename(2)@ to @<path>@. POSIX @rename(2)@ is atomic on
the same filesystem, so concurrent readers always observe
either the previous fully-written value or the new
fully-written value, never partial bytes.

{- | Load the master seed if it already exists at the
given path. Otherwise generate a fresh 32-byte seed
using the global 'StdGen' (system-entropy seeded), write
it atomically, and return it. The file is read-only
after this call from the daemon's perspective: nothing
else writes to it during a run.

Used at daemon startup. NOT on the per-request tx path —
the determinism contract for transact / refill (FR-002)
forbids ambient randomness there, and the seed for
those operations is always supplied by the caller.

{- | Atomic write helper: write to @<path>.tmp@, flush,
close, then @rename@ the temp file over the destination.
Removes the temp file on failure to avoid stale files
accumulating. Creates the parent directory if it does
not exist.

Caveat: this does not call @fsync(2)@ on the file or its
parent directory, so a power loss between @write@ and a
flushed-to-disk @rename@ may leave the file with stale
contents. That is acceptable for the tx-generator's
recovery contract (SC-006): the indexer's chain-sync
state is the authoritative source for replay, and a
stale @next-hd-index@ at most causes a small replay
overlap, never data corruption.
