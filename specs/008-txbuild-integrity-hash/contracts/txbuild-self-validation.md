# Contract: TxBuild self-validation against ledger Phase-1

**Branch**: `008-txbuild-integrity-hash` | **Date**: 2026-05-15

The contract this PR commits to between `Cardano.Tx.Build` and any
caller (test or library or downstream tool).

---

## C-1 Return-type contract

`build` (and any equivalent public entry point in
`Cardano.Tx.Build`) MUST return either:

- `Right (Tx ConwayEra)` — a body that satisfies
  `applyTx pp utxo slot tx == Right _` where `pp` is the
  `PParams` value provided to the build call and `utxo` is
  the UTxO TxBuild used to assemble the body;
- or `Left (Check e)` — a check failure, where
  `LedgerFail (Phase1Rejected err)` carries the ledger's
  `ApplyTxError` verbatim.

There is no third case. A `Right body` whose
`script_integrity_hash` does not match the ledger's
computation is a contract violation and a release blocker.

## C-2 PParams-identity contract

For a single `build` call:

- the `PParams` value used by the fee estimator,
- the `PParams` value used by the exec-units estimator,
- the `PParams` value used by `computeScriptIntegrity`,
- the `PParams` value used by the self-validation
  `applyTx` call,

MUST be `==`-equal. The design enforces this structurally
(one argument wrapped in `PParamsBound`, per
[data-model.md](../data-model.md) E-1).

---

## C-3 Integrity-hash contract

For any `Tx ConwayEra` returned by `build`:

- `body ^. scriptIntegrityHashTxBodyL == SNothing` if and
  only if the body has no redeemers and no witness-set
  datums.
- Otherwise, `body ^. scriptIntegrityHashTxBodyL == SJust h`
  where `h` is computed over:
  - the redeemers exactly as serialized in the witness set
    (Conway map form, witness-set key `5`);
  - the set of language views for languages *referenced by
    the body's redeemers and reference-script inputs* (no
    language view for any language not so referenced);
  - the witness-set datums map (`TxDats` value, may be empty
    for inline-only datum txs);
  - keyed off the same `PParams` as C-2.

---

## C-4 Negative-build contract

If the caller's plan results in a body that fails Phase-1,
`build` returns:

```haskell
Left (LedgerFail (Phase1Rejected err))
```

where `err :: ApplyTxError ConwayEra` is the unmodified value
the ledger produced. `Cardano.Tx.Build` does NOT pretty-print,
classify, or otherwise mangle the error before returning it
— callers may pattern-match on `err` for their own UX.

---

## C-5 Reproduction-fixture contract

The mainnet `swap-cancel` reproduction
(tx `84b2bb78f7f5dd2beb2830e8e6e88fd853a8f70ea73b161f0a0327de8c70146f`)
replayed offline through `build` against
`test/fixtures/pparams.json` MUST yield:

- `Right body`,
- with `body ^. scriptIntegrityHashTxBodyL` `== SJust
  41a7cd5798b8b6f081bfaee0f5f88dc02eea894b7ed888b2a8658b3784dcdcf9`,
- and `applyTx pp utxo slot body == Right _`.

The test asserting this lives in `test/Cardano/Tx/BuildSpec.hs`
and runs under `nix flake check`. Per constitution VI it MUST
NOT open a network socket.

---

## C-6 Downstream contract: no duplicate Phase-1 gates

After this PR lands, callers of `build` SHOULD NOT add a
second Phase-1 validation pass on the returned body. The
companion `amaru-treasury-tx` ticket proposing such a gate is
closed as superseded.

This is "SHOULD NOT" rather than "MUST NOT" because nothing
prevents a caller from re-running `applyTx` on the returned
body — it is simply redundant.

---

## C-7 Stability contract

C-1..C-5 are stable invariants of the `Cardano.Tx.Build`
public API. Any future change that weakens them — for
example, adding a "skip self-validation for performance"
flag — is a breaking change and requires its own spec/PR.
