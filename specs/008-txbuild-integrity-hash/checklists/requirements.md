# Specification Quality Checklist: TxBuild self-validates against ledger Phase-1

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-05-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Constitutional Alignment

- [x] Principle I (one-way dep on node-clients): the fix lives in `Cardano.Tx.Build` / `Cardano.Tx.Scripts`; no reverse import is introduced.
- [x] Principle II (module namespace): all touched modules under `Cardano.Tx.*`.
- [x] Principle III (Conway-only): the fix targets Conway tx bodies only.
- [x] Principle IV (Hackage-ready): no API-surface change is anticipated; Haddock task lives in Phase 5.
- [x] Principle VI (default-offline): the regression test uses on-disk fixtures and never opens a socket.
- [x] Principle VII (TDD vertical commits): tasks.md enforces RED + GREEN folded into one commit per behavior change.

## Notes

- The spec deliberately references some ledger-side concepts (CBOR keys `0b` / `5`, Plutus language versions, witness-set datums map) because the bug is defined by them; this is not implementation leakage — it is the contract the produced tx body must satisfy with the ledger.
- One named ledger function appears (`applyTx` from `cardano-ledger-api`); kept because it pins down what "Phase-1 validation" means for the regression test and is unambiguous.
