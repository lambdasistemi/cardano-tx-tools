# Feature Specification: TxBuild self-validates against ledger Phase-1

**Feature Branch**: `008-txbuild-integrity-hash`
**Created**: 2026-05-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: GitHub issue [lambdasistemi/cardano-tx-tools#8](https://github.com/lambdasistemi/cardano-tx-tools/issues/8)
**Predecessor**: [lambdasistemi/cardano-node-clients#153](https://github.com/lambdasistemi/cardano-node-clients/issues/153) (closed as moved), [PR draft #154](https://github.com/lambdasistemi/cardano-node-clients/pull/154) (closed as superseded). The full spec was first drafted in that repo before `tx-build` was extracted to `cardano-tx-tools`; this document is the authoritative form.

## Background

TxBuild today (`Cardano.Tx.Build`, in this repo as of commit `22d0001`) can emit a Conway transaction body that fails ledger Phase-1 validation. The concrete bug surfaced as a `script_integrity_hash` (CBOR key `0b`) mismatch — reproduced on mainnet via `amaru-treasury-tx swap-cancel` (tx `84b2bb78f7f5dd2beb2830e8e6e88fd853a8f70ea73b161f0a0327de8c70146f`):

```
script integrity hash mismatch
  expected (ledger):  41a7cd5798b8b6f081bfaee0f5f88dc02eea894b7ed888b2a8658b3784dcdcf9
  provided (body):    03e9d7edc4e9b65b14a6076b19c7f13810292687b0c51b14c038ee4849f81941
```

The failing tx is a clean PlutusV3 spend: one wallet input used as collateral, one script input (Sundae V3 order) with the inline-datum order, one reference input (Sundae V3 order script), redeemer = `Constr 1 []`, no witness-set datums, one treasury output, one wallet change, plus collateral return.

The deeper problem is that the only way the bug was discovered was *downstream* — when a consumer submitted the tx and the ledger rejected it. The cross-referenced companion ticket on `amaru-treasury-tx` proposes a post-build validation gate in the consumer. That is the wrong place: every consumer would have to re-implement the same gate. TxBuild itself must guarantee that its output is ledger-valid.

This spec re-scopes the work: fix the `script_integrity_hash` divergence *and* make TxBuild responsible for validating every body it produces against the ledger's Phase-1 rules before returning it. The integrity-hash bug becomes one instance of a class TxBuild now self-detects.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 — TxBuild refuses to return a Phase-1-invalid body (Priority: P1)

A caller asks TxBuild to assemble a Conway transaction. TxBuild computes the body, then runs the ledger's Phase-1 validation on that body against the same `PParams` it used during assembly. If Phase-1 rejects the body, TxBuild fails with an error that names the Phase-1 failure (e.g. `script integrity hash mismatch`, `fee too small`, `missing collateral`); it never returns an invalid body to the caller.

**Why this priority**: this is the contract change that makes the bug class impossible to surface downstream again. Without it, fixing only the integrity-hash divergence leaves the next ledger-side change (new era, new cost-model layout, new redeemer form) one bug away from another silent regression.

**Independent Test**: build any Conway tx through TxBuild against a `PParams` snapshot, capture the result. If the body is valid, the call returns it; if forced to be invalid (e.g. by injecting a deliberate `PParams` mismatch in a test harness), the call returns an error naming the Phase-1 failure. No consumer-side validation gate exists.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Conway `PParams` and a TxBuild plan with one PlutusV3 script input, one reference input carrying the script, and a single redeemer, **When** TxBuild assembles the tx body, **Then** the `script_integrity_hash` field in the body equals `hashScriptIntegrity` over (redeemers as serialized in the body witness set, the PlutusV3 cost-model language view from the same `PParams`, the datums in the witness set — none in this case).
2. **Given** the body produced in (1), **When** the ledger's Phase-1 validation is run against the same `PParams` and slot, **Then** the result is `Right _` (no `script integrity hash mismatch`).
3. **Given** the exact mainnet reproduction `swap-cancel` plan (Sundae V3 order, redeemer `Constr 1 []`, no witness-set datums), **When** TxBuild rebuilds the body offline against the committed `test/fixtures/pparams.json` snapshot, **Then** the `script_integrity_hash` field matches the ledger's expected value (`41a7cd5798b8b6f081bfaee0f5f88dc02eea894b7ed888b2a8658b3784dcdcf9`).

### User Story 2 — Consumers no longer carry a duplicate Phase-1 gate (Priority: P1)

The cross-referenced companion ticket on `amaru-treasury-tx` (post-build Phase-1 validation gate in the consumer) is closed. Consumers trust TxBuild's contract: a returned body is ledger-valid against the `PParams` TxBuild was given. Nobody duplicates the gate.

**Why this priority**: the consumer-side gate proposal is the symptom of TxBuild's broken contract. Closing it is how we verify the contract is now strong enough to be relied on.

**Independent Test**: search consumer codebases (starting with `amaru-treasury-tx`) for any post-TxBuild `applyTx` / `evaluateTxBody` style guard; expect zero. The companion ticket on `amaru-treasury-tx` is closed with a link back to this work.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the fix has landed and TxBuild's contract is in force, **When** the `amaru-treasury-tx` companion ticket is reviewed, **Then** it is closed as superseded with a reference to this feature.
2. **Given** any consumer of TxBuild, **When** they call the builder, **Then** they need not re-validate the result before signing/submission to detect Phase-1 issues.

### Edge Cases

- **No Plutus inputs**: tx has no redeemers and no `script_integrity_hash` field (`SNothing`). Self-validation must accept this body.
- **Mixed Plutus versions**: a tx with both PlutusV2 and PlutusV3 inputs includes only V2 and V3 cost-model language views in the integrity hash; self-validation enforces this.
- **PParams sourcing**: TxBuild has exactly one `PParams` instance in scope per build call; the same value feeds fee computation, exec-units estimation, `script_integrity_hash` computation, and self-validation. Two different `PParams` instances in a single build is a programming error and SHOULD be impossible by construction (not just by convention).
- **Inline datum, empty witness-set datums**: the witness-set datums map is empty; the integrity hash and self-validation must reflect that.
- **Stake / cert-only Conway tx**: no scripts, no redeemers. The body still goes through self-validation; the validation must not falsely require Plutus witnesses.
- **Phase-1 failure that is not `script_integrity_hash`**: e.g. insufficient fee, missing collateral, expired validity. Self-validation surfaces the failure with the ledger's own message; TxBuild returns an error, not a body.
- **Self-validation cost**: the call adds one ledger `applyTx`-style evaluation per build. Acceptable as the cost of a strong contract; not opt-out.
- **Default-offline (constitution VI)**: the entire test suite for this feature MUST run with no network access — fixtures (`PParams` snapshot, UTxO, tx body) are on-disk and committed; no LSQ / Blockfrost / HTTPS at test time.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: TxBuild MUST compute `script_integrity_hash` over the redeemers as they appear in the transaction's Conway witness set (map form, witness-set key `5`), using only the cost-model language views for Plutus versions actually referenced by a redeemer in the transaction.
- **FR-002**: TxBuild MUST source the `PParams` value used for fee estimation, exec-units estimation, integrity-hash computation, and self-validation from a single `PParams` instance passed into the build call; the design MUST make a multi-instance bug structurally impossible (single argument threaded through, not re-fetched midway).
- **FR-003**: Before returning a transaction body, TxBuild MUST run the ledger's Phase-1 validation (`applyTx` or the equivalent functional path from `cardano-ledger-api`) on that body against the same `PParams` instance from FR-002 and the UTxO it already has in scope.
- **FR-004**: If Phase-1 validation rejects the body, TxBuild MUST return an error that surfaces the ledger's failure reason (the original `ApplyTxError` value or a faithful rendering thereof). TxBuild MUST NOT return the body in this case.
- **FR-005**: TxBuild MUST omit the `script_integrity_hash` field (`SNothing`) from a body that carries no redeemers and no datums, and self-validation MUST accept such a body.
- **FR-006**: The mainnet `swap-cancel` reproduction from cardano-tx-tools#8 (originally cardano-node-clients#153), replayed offline against the committed `test/fixtures/pparams.json` and a captured UTxO, MUST produce `script_integrity_hash` = `41a7cd5798b8b6f081bfaee0f5f88dc02eea894b7ed888b2a8658b3784dcdcf9` and self-validation MUST return `Right _`. This is enforced by a test in the project's test suite.
- **FR-007**: At least one negative test MUST exercise FR-004: given a deliberately invalid plan (e.g. fee artificially zeroed, or a forced pparams mismatch), TxBuild returns an error naming the Phase-1 failure and does not return a body.
- **FR-008**: The companion `amaru-treasury-tx` ticket (post-build Phase-1 validation gate in the consumer) is closed as superseded by this work. No consumer is expected to carry a duplicate Phase-1 gate.
- **FR-009**: The fix MUST NOT regress any existing passing test in `nix flake check`.

### Key Entities

- **Script integrity hash**: a 32-byte BLAKE2b-256 hash committed to in the tx body (CBOR key `0b`) and recomputed by the ledger from the witnesses + cost-model language views. Mismatch is a Phase-1 validation failure.
- **Language view**: the cost-model entry for a single Plutus version, in the ledger-canonical serialization form for that version.
- **Redeemers (Conway witness set)**: redeemers indexed by `(tag, index)`, serialized as a map in Conway; the integrity hash uses the same serialization the witness set carries.
- **PParams instance**: the protocol-parameter value threaded through a single TxBuild call; single source of truth for fees, exec units, integrity hash, and self-validation.
- **Phase-1 validation**: the ledger's structural / static acceptance check, exposed via `cardano-ledger-api`'s `applyTx` (or equivalent); does NOT run Plutus scripts — Phase-2 does. The script-integrity check happens here.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100 % of TxBuild calls that today produce a Phase-1-valid body continue to return that body; no false rejection.
- **SC-002**: 100 % of TxBuild calls that today produce a Phase-1-invalid body now return an error naming the ledger failure. The previously-shipped mainnet `swap-cancel` reproduction is among these and is rejected with `script integrity hash mismatch` against pre-fix code, and accepted against post-fix code.
- **SC-003**: A grep across the consumer set (starting with `amaru-treasury-tx`) finds zero post-TxBuild Phase-1 validation gates; the companion ticket is closed as superseded.
- **SC-004**: `nix flake check` passes green on the branch.
- **SC-005**: A future ledger / cost-model / era change that breaks the equivalence is caught by TxBuild's self-validation in `nix flake check` (or in the first consumer test run), not by a Phase-1 rejection in production.

## Assumptions

- TxBuild has, at body-return time, access to enough state to run Phase-1 validation: the `PParams` instance, the slot, and the UTxO it already used to construct inputs/collateral. No new external query is required. If this turns out to be false, the spec will be updated and user approval requested before extending the API surface.
- "Ledger Phase-1 validation" in this spec means the ledger function exposed via `cardano-ledger-api` that performs the same static checks the node runs before Plutus script execution. Phase-2 (Plutus script execution) is out of scope — this work does not promise script-logic validation, only that bodies are well-formed and self-consistent with witnesses and PParams.
- `test/fixtures/pparams.json` is the canonical mainnet snapshot. Its applicability to issue #8's specific failing slot is verified empirically by SC-002.
- The work is confined to `src/Cardano/Tx/Build.hs` and `src/Cardano/Tx/Scripts.hs` and their tests. If the fix forces a `Cardano.Tx.Build` public-API change, the spec is updated and user approval requested before the API moves.
- Closing the `amaru-treasury-tx` companion ticket is part of the deliverable (see FR-008 / SC-003) but happens after the TxBuild fix lands — the consumer ticket is closed *as superseded by this PR*, with a backlink.
