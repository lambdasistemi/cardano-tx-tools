Module      : Cardano.Tx.Generator.SnapshotSpec
Description : Unit tests for the snapshot percentiles
License     : Apache-2.0

Pins the nearest-rank percentile calculation in
'Cardano.Tx.Generator.Snapshot.percentiles'.

The CBOR-decode side ('decodeIdxTxOut') is exercised
end-to-end by the T014 snapshot E2E spec — there is no
straightforward way to construct an indexer-encoded
TxOut at unit-test scope without pulling in the full
ledger machinery.
