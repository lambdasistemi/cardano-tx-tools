# Canonical vocab pin — provenance

Vendored snapshot of the canonical `cardano:` vocab from
[lambdasistemi/cardano-knowledge-maps](https://github.com/lambdasistemi/cardano-knowledge-maps),
the source of truth for predicate declarations consumed by the
body emitter.

## Current pin

- **File**: [`transactions.ttl`](./transactions.ttl) (303 lines)
- **Source**: `data/rdf/transactions.ttl`
- **Repo**: `lambdasistemi/cardano-knowledge-maps`
- **SHA**: `8597fbd571188b42999ee0b24a8247bda7e717b9` (kmaps `main`
  HEAD on 2026-05-20)
- **Version label** declared in the file: `0.1.0-phaseA`

## Why pin?

The `VocabTraceabilitySpec` invariant (per spec FR-013, the
strict vocab-traceability extension) asserts that every emitted
CURIE in the body emitter's output traces to a term declared in
the canonical vocab. To keep that check deterministic and
offline-buildable, this directory carries a verbatim copy of the
canonical file rather than reaching out to GitHub at test time.

The pin is refreshed in dedicated `chore(070): refresh
canonical-vocab pin to kmaps@<sha>` commits — never on the same
commit as a behavior-changing slice (per A-002's decoupling
rationale).

## Lifecycle (per A-002 / A-004)

1. **Now (this commit)** — pin at kmaps@8597fbd57, the Phase A
   HEAD that exists today. None of the proposed Phase A.1
   additions live here yet.
2. **Slice T110a (before T103 emits a Phase A.1 predicate)** —
   refresh to the `phase-a1-tx-semantic-predicates` branch tip of
   [kmaps#55](https://github.com/lambdasistemi/cardano-knowledge-maps/pull/55)
   so the strict CI gate is satisfied as Phase A.1 predicates
   start emitting.
3. **Slice T110b (finalization, before T113 drops `gate.sh`)** —
   refresh to the merged kmaps `main` SHA once kmaps#55 lands.
   Blocks PR #77 finalization.

## Refresh recipe

```bash
# Fetch the latest version from a known SHA:
curl -sL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lambdasistemi/cardano-knowledge-maps/<sha>/data/rdf/transactions.ttl" \
  -o test/fixtures/canonical-vocab/transactions.ttl

# Update this file's "Current pin" section with the new SHA + date.
# Commit subject: `chore(070): refresh canonical-vocab pin to kmaps@<sha>`.
```
